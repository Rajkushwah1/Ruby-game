- Growing Snake: Each time the snake touches the target, it grows longer.
- Score Tracking: The score increases every time the snake eats the target.
- Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with its own body.
- Sound Effects: Background music and sound effects are played using MP3 files.
- Pause/Resume: Press P to pause or resume the game.
- Restart: Press R to restart the game.
- Exit: Press E to exit the game.
